title: Adding data from a Web Feature Service (WFS)
description: Learn how to add live-updating vector data from an OGC Web Feature Service (WFS) endpoint directly into your Mundi maps.

[Web Feature Services (WFS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wfs/) are a standard way to share and access vector
geospatial data over the internet. Mundi supports WFS sources, meaning layers in Mundi
can continuously update to an external WFS server.

This guide demonstrates how to connect to a WFS server using Mundi, using a
[public GeoServer instance from Statistics Finland](https://stat.fi/en) as an example.

## Add layer from remote WFS source

Once you have [opened a Mundi map](/getting-started/making-your-first-map/), in the bottom of the
layer list, click the **Add layer source** (**+**) icon.
Then, from the dropdown, click **Connect to WFS**.

### Configure the WFS Connection

The **Connect to WFS** dialog requires a name for your layer and a specific
URL to fetch the data.

1.  **Layer Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the layer, this will appear
    in the layer list. For this example, we'll use `Finland Data`.
2.  **WFS Service URL**: Paste the full WFS `GetFeature` request URL into this
    field. This URL tells the remote server exactly which dataset you want to
    access.

#### Understanding the WFS `GetFeature` URL

In this demo, we're using `https://geo.stat.fi/geoserver/wfs?service=WFS&version=2.0.0&request=GetFeature&typename=vaestoruutu:vaki2021_5km&maxfeatures=10` as our WFS URL.

This is slightly different from most WFS configurations, because most implementations
of WFS ask for the `GetCapabilities` URL or merely the `/wfs` endpoint. Here,
you need to specify precisely which layer you want to fetch using `GetFeature`.

So in this case, we're providing `typename=vaestoruutu:vaki2021_5km` to get a particular
layer from GeoServer. You can ignore `maxfeatures`.

Once the correct URL is in place, click the **Connect to WFS** button. Mundi
will fetch the data, create tiles for fast rendering, and automatically
set up polling to keep the data synchronized with the source.

## Exploring the Loaded WFS Data

After a successful connection, the layer will be added to your map and the
data will be displayed.

In our example, a grid of data for Finland appears. The **Map Layers**
panel confirms the layer has been added, showing a total of `10,359` features and
noting the data's original Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is `EPSG:3067`.

You can interact with this data just like any other vector layer in Mundi.
Zoom in to see the individual grid cells, and click on any feature to open a
popup displaying its attributes.
